# Patch Antenna Design

## Description
Design quarter wavelength feed patch antenna and recessed patch antenna to meet project specifications.  Simulate and analyze linear end fire array of patch antenna design.

## Procedure
1)	Create initial design on paper using equations
2)	Model and perform simulation of design in HFSS
3)	Optimize design using HFSS Optimetrics by adjusting antenna dimensions
4)	Simulate new design and verify that specifications have been met
